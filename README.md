# Human-Detection-through-CCTV


CCTV cameras as a piece of technology has improved the livelihood of several individuals, many testimonies justifying the need of these 
devices can be collected and put forth to advocate the need for technological advancements

The traditional surveillance system has not been able to solve the issue of safeguarding the restricted areas effectively. 
The cameras do not notify the owner about the crime or the unethical activity happening at that particular moment. 
Other concern is that cameras keep on recording each and every activity, in this process of recording each and every activity it becomes 
a very tedious process to find the particular video clip when the crime actually happened. To record and store every activity requires huge 
amount of storage space leading to the wastage of memory.

These problems would be removed by building a smart CCTV surveillance camera that would start recording only when humans enter the frame 
and automatically stops recording when there is no human in the frame. The owner can be notified the moment human enters the frame through 
alarm systems such as sending SMS and Emails. YOLO algorithm can be used to detect the presence of humans in the live video frame of CCTV and 
for capturing the images and videos OpenCV can be used.
